# Before vs. After: The NyayaSaathi Impact

| Feature | 🚫 Current System (Rahul's Struggle) | ✅ NyayaSaathi System (Rahul's Future) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Filing an FIR** | **Physical Travel:** Must go to station, often turned away. Language barrier. | **Voice-First (NyayaSetu):** File from home in Hindi/Regional language via app. AI drafts the legal text. |
| **Evidence** | **Vulnerable:** Phone video transferred via USB/WhatsApp. Hash value rarely recorded. Easy to tamper. | **Immutable (Akhand Ledger):** Uploaded instantly. SHA-256 hash anchored to blockchain. Admissible under BSA Sec 63. |
| **Updates** | **Black Box:** Rahul must visit the station repeatedly to ask "Kya hua?" (What happened?). | **Transparent:** Real-time SMS/App notifications: "Investigating Officer Assigned", "Charge Sheet Filed". |
| **Timeline** | **Indefinite:** Investigation can drag for years without oversight. | **Deadline-Driven:** BNSS 193 Timer alerts SP/Magistrate if charge sheet hits 60/90 day limit. |
| **Court Hearing** | **Adjournments:** "Tareekh pe Tareekh". Case delayed due to missing files or judge workload. | **AI-Assisted:** Judge uses "Bail Reckoner" & "Case Summary" to make faster decisions. Fewer adjournments. |
| **Total Time** | **5-15 Years** | **3-5 Years** (Target) |
